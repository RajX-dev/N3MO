> **A Modular Code Search Engine with Sandboxed Execution**

CodeSeer is a developer tool designed to bridge the gap between static code search and dynamic code verification. It allows developers to index local repositories, search for code using keyword matching (and experimental semantic search), and **execute discovered snippets** in a secure, isolated container environment.

This project serves as an exploration into **system design, compiler engineering, and sandboxing architectures**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Hybrid Search Architecture
* **Lexical Search:** Fast, precise symbol matching (variables, function names) using TF-IDF/Inverted Indices.
* **Semantic Discovery:** [OPTIONAL: Delete if not using ML] Experimental support for vector embeddings (CodeBERT) to find code by "intent" rather than just syntax.

### 2. Live Sandboxed Execution 🛡️
* **Instant Verification:** Users can execute search results directly from the API/UI.
* **Containerized Isolation:** Spawns ephemeral Docker containers for every execution request.
* **Stateful Feedback:** Captures `stdout`, `stderr`, and exit codes to provide immediate feedback on code behavior.

### 3. C++ Static Analysis (Optimization)
* **Performance-First:** Uses a custom C++ module (`analysis-cpp`) for heavy AST parsing and metric calculation.
* **Why C++?** Offloading CPU-bound parsing tasks to C++ prevents the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) from becoming a bottleneck during indexing.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

CodeSeer is designed as a **modular monolith**, decoupling the ingestion pipeline from the search and execution logic for future scalability.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B(API Gateway - FastAPI)
    
    subgraph "Ingestion Pipeline"
    B -->|Trigger Scan| C[Crawler Service]
    C -->|Raw Code| D[C++ Analyzer]
    D -->|AST & Metadata| E[Search Index]
    end

    subgraph "Execution Engine"
    B -->|Execute Request| F[Sandbox Manager]
    F -->|Spawn| G[Docker Container]
    G -->|Result| F
    end

    subgraph "Storage"
    E --> H[(PostgreSQL / Metadata)]
    E --> I[(Vector/Text Index)]
    end

```

### Engineering Decisions

* **Monolithic vs. Microservices:** Given the current scale, a modular monolith was chosen to reduce deployment complexity and network latency, while keeping components (Crawler, Analyzer, API) distinct for potential future separation.
* **Sandbox Strategy:** Standard Docker containers are used for environment consistency.
* *Note: For a production environment, this would be upgraded to `gVisor` or `Firecracker` microVMs to prevent container-escape vulnerabilities.*

## 🔮 Roadmap (Future Work)

This project is actively evolving. The following features are designed but not fully implemented:

* **Distributed Crawling:** Moving to a Redis-backed URL frontier to support multi-node crawling.
* **Security Hardening:** Implementing `seccomp` filters and network jailing for the sandbox.
* **Advanced Ranking:** Implementing Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to better weight semantic vs. lexical results.
